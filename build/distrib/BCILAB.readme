Before you start, you need to install the free MATLAB Compiler runtime (see release notes for the download link).

Then, to start the binary under:
* Windows: double-click the file that corresponds to your OS.
* Linux: from the shell, cd into this directory, and invoke ./run_build.sh /your/path/to/the/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v717
* MacOS: from the shell, cd into /path/to/bcilab/build/distrib/build.app/Contents/MacOS then run the contained ./applauncher

Note that it takes a while for the runtime engine to start, especially when running for the first time.
